Samsung's design previously depicted this as a smiley in a ghost costume. This emoji predates the inclusion of emojis within Unicode .

This emoji goes back to the late 1990s when it was included in Docomo's emoji set . In 2009, it appeared on a proposal as one of many symbols available on Japanese phones recommended to be encoded into the Unicode Standard. In that proposal, the symbol was referred to as a \"recreational vehicle\" or RV. The original Japanese emojis look more like station wagons or SUVs than RVs. At various points, platforms including Google and Samsung showed this emoji as an RV, but ultimately the designs across platforms converged to a car that looks more like an SUV or station wagon.

Both Microsoft and Twitter‚Äôs sparkles were¬†previously¬†multicolored, while¬†Samsung‚Äôs sparkles were previously depicted on a night sky, suggesting firework sparklers . Twitter's mobile app uses ‚ú® Sparkles as a button users can tap to toggle between latest and top tweets on their timeline. Similar emojis¬†with less implied meaning include ‚≠ê Star , üåü Glowing Star , and üí´ Dizzy . This emoji predates emojis inclusion within Unicode .

       "      <td>A classic red love heart emoji. The red heart ideograph¬†is traditionally used for expressions of love and romance across many cultures, with this being amongst the most frequence use cases for this emoji. However, the Red Heart emoji is also often used to express non-romantic positive sentiments, in part thanks to its use as one of the default reaction emoji options across many social messaging platforms (e.g. Instagram , Slack , WhatsApp ). Additionally, as with the other color-based hearts, this emoji is often also used to express an affinity with or appreciation for various people, places, groups, objects, or ideas associated with the same color. This is historically the most popular heart emoji by a considerable distance and is amongst the most popular emojis of all time. A similar¬†emoji exists¬†for the heart suit in a deck of playing cards. On Snapchat , this emoji displays next to a friend¬†when you have been #1 BFs with each other for two consecutive weeks. Note: the Unicode Character Database (UCD)¬†name ‚ÄúHeavy Black Heart‚Äù¬†pre-dates color emoji, when the term referred to a solid, black ‚ù§Ô∏é heart character.
